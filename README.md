# Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning
Predicting the weather of a city using Linear Regression and Convolutional Neural Network.
The dataset is extracted using the Dark Sky API.

The project was created with the help fo the [Stack Abuse Article]<href = "https://stackabuse.com/using-machine-learning-to-predict-the-weather-part-1/">

In this project the two models performed quite similarly with the more simple Linear Regression model being slightly better. This was done to show that it is not advisable, to simply rely on one model or the most recent hot topic in the machine learning community. 
Every algorithm performs differently for ever dataset and one can only conclude by comparing the different models on the same dataset.
